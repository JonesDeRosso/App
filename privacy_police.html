  <h1>Privacy Policy for TopOut</h1>

  <h2>1. General Information</h2>
  <p>TopOut takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. All data you enter or generate in the app is stored locally on your device only. We do not collect, process, or share any personal data with third parties.</p>

    <li>accurately show mountain and summit positions,</li>
    <li>optionally display routes or your surroundings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Background Location</h3>
  <p>If you use the app in the background (e.g., during a hike), the location is only used on your device to keep the map up-to-date. No location data is sent to external servers.</p>

    <li>that you can revoke the permission at any time in the settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. No Data Collection or Tracking</h2>
  <p>No analytics tools, no advertising, no tracking. All information about your marked summits remains exclusively on your device.</p>

  <p>TopOut may optionally require:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Storage access: to save your own notes or screenshots.</li>
    <li>Optional camera permission: only if you want to save photos of summits directly in the app.</li>
  </ul>
